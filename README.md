# Prioritizer

A simple tool to help you focus on your prioritized tasks.

## Usage

Try adding the following URL query params to the URL:

`?message=Create%20impotant%20plan&color=red&message=Work%20on%20moderate%20task&color=green&message=Reply%20messages&color=blue`

You will see the default message and background color, and by clicking the page, you will see three tasks along with animated background color based on the configured base color of each task.

Create your own prioritized task list by modified the query params above and send it to your favorite device, and you can use this to display and help switch your focus between these tasks.
